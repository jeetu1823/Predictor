# 🌸 Flower Classification ML WebApp 🌸  

This project is a machine learning-based web application for classifying flowers into **Setosa**, **Versicolour**, or **Virginica** based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The app integrates with a MySQL database to store user input and predictions, which can be used to improve the model's accuracy over time.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- **Flower Classification:** Predicts the type of flower based on user-provided dimensions.  
- **Database Integration:** Inputs and predictions are stored in a MySQL database for future reference.  
- **Future Model Improvement:** The stored data can be used for retraining the model to enhance accuracy.  
- **Interactive UI:** Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive and user-friendly interface.  

---

## 🌐 Database Details  

The project uses a MySQL database hosted on [CloudClusters](https://clients.cloudclusters.io/). When a user enters data and hits the **Predict** button, the input and the predicted flower type are stored in the database.  

**Example of the Database Structure:**

This data will later be used to retrain the model, further improving its accuracy.

## 🎨 User Interface  

The user-friendly interface allows users to input flower dimensions and view the classification result instantly:

## ⚙️ Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-classification.git  
   cd flower-classification
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Ensure Python is installed. Then, run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database:**  
   - Connect to the MySQL database using the provided connection details.  
   - Create a table `input_data` using the following schema:  
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE input_data (
       Sepal_length FLOAT,
       Sepal_width FLOAT,
       Petal_length FLOAT,
       Petal_width FLOAT,
       predicted_value VARCHAR(255)
     );
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**  
   Start the Streamlit server by running:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the App:**  
   Open the link provided by Streamlit in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
